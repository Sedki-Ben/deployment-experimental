  "Mission Description": "This project traces its roots to a journey that began in 2017. As a member of the editorial team behind Küstenstern, I helped shape the platform into a vibrant space for football, followed by over 100,000 devoted supporters of Étoile Sportive du Sahel.\n\nLater came Le Bonhomme Libre, a venture that drew over 50,000 loyal readers and earned acclaim for its respectful and nuanced coverage of the game.\n\nToday, I take a step beyond the borders of my beloved Étoile du Sahel—not in departure, but in expansion. With the launch of Pure Tactics Cartel, I carry this enduring passion into new arenas.\n\nFrom the heart of Tunisian football, I now turn my lens toward the global game—analysing international fixtures, the grand theatres of the World Cup and Champions League, and the tactical intricacies of top leagues such as La Liga, the Premier League, and beyond.\n\nPTC stands as both a tribute and a transformation: a space where tactical intelligence meets cultural insight, and where the love for football is spoken in many languages.",
